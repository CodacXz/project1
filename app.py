### Question:
https://api.stockdata.org/v1/news/all?countries=sa&filter_entities=true&limit=10&published_after=2025-02-02T11:01&api_token=bS2jganHVlFYtAly7ttdHYLrTB0s6BmONWmFEApD

### Answer:
I apologize, but there seems to be an error in the URL you provided. The date in the `published_after` parameter is set to a future date (2025-02-02), which is not valid for fetching news articles. News APIs typically don't allow fetching articles from the future.

Let me help you correct this URL and explain how to use it in the context of your project:

1. First, let's correct the URL:

```
https://api.stockdata.org/v1/news/all?countries=sa&filter_entities=true&limit=10&published_after=2023-06-02T11:01&api_token=bS2jganHVlFYtAly7ttdHYLrTB0s6BmONWmFEApD
```

I've changed the `published_after` date to today's date (assuming today is June 2, 2023). You should replace this with the actual date from which you want to fetch news.

2. Now, let's modify your `fetch_news` function to use this new API. Here's how you can update it:

**File: c:\Users\DELL\Downloads\test3-main (3)\test3-main\app.py**
```python
import requests
import streamlit as st

def fetch_news(published_after, limit=10):
    """Fetch news articles"""
    NEWS_API_URL = "https://api.stockdata.org/v1/news/all"
    API_TOKEN = "bS2jganHVlFYtAly7ttdHYLrTB0s6BmONWmFEApD"  # Consider moving this to st.secrets

    params = {
        "api_token": API_TOKEN,
        "countries": "sa",
        "filter_entities": "true",
        "limit": limit,
        "published_after": published_after,
        "language": "en"
    }
    try:
        response = requests.get(NEWS_API_URL, params=params, timeout=10)
        response.raise_for_status()
        data = response.json()
        return data.get("data", [])
    except Exception as e:
        st.error(f"Error fetching news: {str(e)}")
        return []
```

Key changes:
1. Updated the `NEWS_API_URL` to use the stockdata.org API.
2. Changed the API token to the one provided in your URL.
3. Removed the `must_have_entities` and `group_similar` parameters as they don't appear to be supported by this API.
4. Adjusted the return statement to match the expected structure of the API response.

Please note:
- It's generally not a good practice to include API keys directly in your code. Consider moving the API_TOKEN to your `st.secrets` for better security.
- Make sure to review the stockdata.org API documentation to ensure you're using all available and relevant parameters.
- The `published_after` parameter should be a string in the format "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM".

You can call this function in your main code like this:

```python
news_articles = fetch_news("2023-06-02T11:01", limit=10)
```

This will fetch up to 10 news articles published after June 2, 2023, at 11:01 AM, related to Saudi Arabia. Adjust the date and time as needed for your application.
